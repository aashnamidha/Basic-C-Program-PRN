# Basic-C-Program-PRN
## Aim
To creat a program to input a 11 digit PRN and display it.
## Description
In this program we use the basic printf() and scanf() functions for input and output.  We use the data type of "long long int" for PRN since it is a 11 digit number that does not fall in the range of int, double etc. 
## Output
